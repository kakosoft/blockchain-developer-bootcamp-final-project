## Carbon Coin: An incentivation system for deep decarbonization

The goal of the project is to implement a basic PoC for the cryptocurrency proposed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future"> The Ministry of the Future</a> science-fiction book, also explained by the author in this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kim_stanley_robinson_remembering_climate_change_a_message_from_the_year_2071">TED talk</a>.

The idea is that coins are issued for not burning carbon: 1 carbon coin = 1 ton of carbon not burned or sequestered. 

"Proof of carbon sequestration" is externally audited and confimed in the blockchain by an independent international organization. 

1. There will be a whitelist of auditors that can mint coins when they validate a new carbon sequestration project.
2. Carbon coins behaves as bonds, with guaranteed rates (i.e. 5%) of return for a fixed amount of time (i.e. 10 years).
3. Carbon coins are freely traded. At the end of the year it is the owner of each coin who receives the interest coupon (if not expired).
